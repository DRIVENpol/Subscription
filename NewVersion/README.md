Back in April, I wrote an article about how you can create a subscription-based smart contract that allows users to perform actions only if they paid a monthly fee in ERC20 tokens or in blockchain's native tokens. After I got a lot of good feedback about it, I decided to make an upgraded version that can be inherited like Ownable.sol from OpenZeppelin.
